# KINTAMAnga - a manga crawler and reader

Wonder why there is sudden lowercase in last 3 characters in the name?
Read Gintama and you will know the meaning of the first capitalized characters.

## Status

Nearly abandoned due to low interest in native Android developement.
Kotlin is great and it helps much but Android's suck.

My vision is all about Flutter or PWA.
And if PWA, hopefully can do resource-consuming things by WASM, loving Rust currently but still a noob.

## Install

Download from [release](https://github.com/InNoobWeTrust/KINTAMAnga/releases) page.

## Building

Please see [github actions for this repo and follow](./.github/workflows/)

## Contributing

Not welcoming! Kidding, you are welcome to contribute but I won't be very active on this repo anymore.

You need some knowledge about Kotlin or alternatively how to use search engines and stackoverflow.

Knowledge about Android should be good, but if you don't, just messing around until it compiles.

And no, no Java here, we don't do that here, Kotlin or quit game. I can do Java but I don't like it.

If you want to mess this repo by integrating React-native, NativeScript, Xamarin, Ionic, Qt, Beeware, Jasonelle, Love (Lua), etc... be sure to do it properly.

Flutter integration PRs are more than welcome! ðŸ˜˜
